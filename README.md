Objective

Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains.
The model predicts the probability of the next word based on the previous one(s), generating coherent and random sentences that mimic the style of the input text.

Description

In this project, a Markov Chain model is built using Python.
The algorithm:

Takes a sample text as input.

Builds a Markov chain dictionary mapping each word to possible next words.

Randomly generates new text sequences based on these probabilities.

This project is part of ProDigy Infotech – Task 3 (Comillas Negras).

Features

Word-level text generation

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

Can be customized for different text datasets

Works fully offline in Google Colab or local Python environment

How to Run

Open the file Task_03_Markov_Chain.ipynb in Google Colab.

Click Runtime → Run all.

Wait for the output to appear — a generated text paragraph will display below the code.

(Optional) Replace the input text with your own dataset to generate text in a different style.

Sample Output
✅ Generated Text:
